The National Center for Wellness and Recovery (NCWR) at OSU Medicine was founded through $177.5M in funding from this historic settlement. Moreover, through an unprecedented collaboration with Purdue Pharma separate from the court case, NCWR received the world’s largest collection of biosamples and novel research molecules for pain and addiction research representing $1B and 20 years worth of scientific data. Armed with these resources for researching addiction and providing greater access to evidence-based treatments, we are bringing hope to our communities and families devastated by America’s opioid epidemic.
