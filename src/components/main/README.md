# main
## Description & Behavior
The main component serves as a container for page components. Each page has different components and this is managed in the CMS. Do not hard-code any components here even if they appear on every page of the prototype.

## Animations & Transitions
<!-- Should this component transition in or out in a certain way? Are there any hover animations? Describe anything that a static image of the component doesn't display.  -->
